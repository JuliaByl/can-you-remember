<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



This Is a simple memory game, inspirated by the current worldwide events. It will be designed in a way that is pleasing to the eye, and challenging to the mind. It also takes into consideration the importance of staying safe during covid-19, and will have a special theme dedicated to educate about protecting yourself and others. It is a multi level game with different themes, and a special level for those who want more of a challenge. 

Below this text I have attached two wireframe examples of the website, one with an in-game example, and the other one is a more complete description of the components of the game. 
To see complete wireframes, click [**HERE**](images/wireframes/complete-wireframes.png).
