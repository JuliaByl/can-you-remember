<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



This Is a simple memory game, inspirated by the current worldwide events. It will be designed in a way that is pleasing to the eye, and challenging to the mind. It also takes into consideration the importance of staying safe during covid-19, and will have a special theme dedicated to educate about protecting yourself and others. It is a multi level game with different themes, and a special level for those who want more of a challenge. 

Below this text I have attached two wireframe examples of the website, one with an in-game example, and the other one is a more complete description of the components of the game.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### User Stories

As a user I want to...

* ...feel motivated to stay in the game - by getting challenged and having multiple choices to pick between
* ...be able to stay in the game for longer without straining my eyes - by having the possibility to choose dark mode
* ...learn something - by getting a useful theme focused on learning about current events
* ...navigate easily throughout the game - by having everything easily accessible and instructions to not cause confusion

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap


### Bugs

[Link to github issues section](https://github.com/JuliaByl/can-you-remember/issues)

### Bigger changes to the website
* I decided to remove the "mix all themes" - theme as it doesn't seem essential for what I'm trying to do. I want to be able to focus more on all the other aspects of the game.

* In the end there was no time for Demon Mode feature, so I moved over Dark Theme button to previous Demon Mode - button.

### Testing

* [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://github.com/JuliaByl/can-you-remember/blob/master/images/validation/html-validation.png)
* [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://github.com/JuliaByl/can-you-remember/blob/master/images/validation/css-validation.png)
* [JSHint Javascript Linter](https://jshint.com/) - [Results](https://github.com/JuliaByl/can-you-remember/blob/master/images/validation/javascript-validation.png)
* [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) - [Results](https://github.com/JuliaByl/can-you-remember/blob/master/images/validation/accessibility-validation.png)

#### Testing User Stories

1. As a user I want to feel motivated to stay in the game - by getting challenged and having multiple choices to pick between

	1. As users clear levels, they unlock newer, more difficult levels
	2. Clear times are saved, and the best time for a level is displayed, allowing users to challenge themselves to be faster
	3. At any time, users can decide to change theme to experience the game again with a different aesthetic

2. As a user I want to be able to stay in the game for longer without straining my eyes - by having the possibility to choose dark mode

	1. A dark mode button is visible and clearly distinct upon first entering the site, and is present at all times

3. As a user I want to learn something - by getting a useful theme focused on learning about current events

	1. One of the themes addresses the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and teaches users how to handle the current situation.

4. As a user I want to navigate easily throughout the game - by having everything easily accessible and instructions to not cause confusion

	1. Upon visiting the site, the user is greeted with a welcome page that gives a brief summary of the site's purpose, and links to the game rules.
	2. The game rules clearly explain how to proceed and play the game without causing any confusion.

#### Further Testing


-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
